        Dark web definition
        The dark web is a part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines. You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of criminal activity — and it is. Researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King's College in London classified the contents of 2,723 live dark web sites over a five-week period in 2015 and found that 57% host illicit material. 
        A 2019 study, Into the Web of Profit, conducted by Dr. Michael McGuires at the University of Surrey, shows that things have become worse. The number of dark web listings that could harm an enterprise has risen by 20% since 2016. Of all listings (excluding those selling drugs), 60% could potentially harm enterprises.
        You can buy credit card numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, hacked Netflix accounts and software that helps you break into other people’s computers. Buy login credentials to a $50,000 Bank of America account for $500. Get $3,000 in counterfeit $20 bills for $600. Buy seven prepaid debit cards, each with a $2,500 balance, for $500 (express shipping included). A “lifetime” Netflix premium account goes for $6. You can hire hackers to attack computers for you. You can buy usernames and passwords.

          All this activity, this vision of a bustling marketplace, might make you think that navigating the dark web is easy. It isn’t. The place is as messy and chaotic as you would expect when everyone is anonymous, and a substantial minority are out to scam others. 

          Accessing the dark web requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor. 
          The Tor browser routes your web page requests through a series of proxy servers
           operated by thousands of volunteers around the globe, rendering your IP addres
           s unidentifiable and untraceable. Tor works like magic, but the result is an experience 
           that’s like the dark web itself: unpredictable, unreliable and maddeningly slow.

      <h1>Dark web sites</h1>
      <p>
          Dark web sites look pretty much like any other site, but there are important differences. 
          One is the naming structure. Instead of ending in .com or .co, dark web sites end in 
          .onion. That’s “a special-use top level domain suffix designating an anonymous hidden 
          service reachable via the Tor network,” according to Wikipedia. Browsers with the
           appropriate proxy can reach these sites, but others can’t.
          Dark web sites also use a scrambled naming structure that creates URLs that are often 
          impossible to remember. For example, a popular commerce site called Dream Market goes by 
          the unintelligible address of “eajwlvm3z2lcca76.onion.”
